# Old Layout for Facebook 
## connection page
##### To describe my project I use the CAR method (C : Chalenge , A : Action , R : Result)
###### C : So the challenge is to code a Facebook page using basic languages without using resources.
###### A : I used HTML/CSS to code the page. Also, I linked my page with a BD to save the information from the input fields. I used PHP to extract the data from the webpage and then saved it in BD using a SQL query.
###### R : I'm pleased with the result and plan to enhance my PHP skills by studying the Laravel framework.
